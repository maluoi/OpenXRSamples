# OpenXR Sample

This is the sample code to accompany my [Introduction to OpenXR](https://playdeck.net/blog/introduction-to-openxr) blog post! Check it out to get the complete context for this repository :) Or just clone it and go!

This is a single file, C style example of getting started with OpenXR and DirectX 11 on WMR, HoloLens 2, and Oculus Desktop. The code is designed to be readable above all else, and contains plenty of comments explaining everything!
